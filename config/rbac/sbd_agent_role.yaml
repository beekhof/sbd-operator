# Permission to read its own pod information

# Permission to read node information
# Needed to resolve node names to node IDs for SBD operations
# Read-only access ensures agent cannot modify cluster state

# NOTE: SBD Agent does NOT have permissions to:
# - Delete or modify pods/nodes (fencing is done via SBD device + local panic)
# - Access secrets or configmaps
# - Modify any cluster resources
# - Access other namespaces beyond reading nodes/pods
#
# The agent's fencing mechanism works through:
# 1. Writing fence messages to the SBD block device
# 2. Local system panic/reboot when self-fence is detected
# 3. Watchdog timeout for additional safety
